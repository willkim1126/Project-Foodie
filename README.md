## Introduction
Being a big food enthusiast, a large dataset of recipes sparked my curiosity in what how I can utilize the dataset and incorporate data science skills into creating something where I can deepen my food knowledge.

'You are what you eat'. By analyzing the dataset that contains over 83,000 data, I aim to understand 'food' in a higher dimension. 

### Research Question
In this project I aim to answer the question of 'How can we analyze recipes to....'
